# Set Indexing Options
- Script to set indexed locations under "Indexing Options"
- Group policy allows to include or exclude locations, but it won't override defaults or already set indexing options. 
- 3 different scripts:
  -"Set_Indexing_To_ StartMenus_Only" and "Set_Indexing_To_ WinStartMenu_Only" are more for post-install/deployment.
  -1st one will add both start menus, 2nd one only Windows/Start Menu as unique location, 
  -Set_Indexing_Options is an "interactive" script (with a fancy browser) which allows to set your desired location(s) for search
  indexing.
